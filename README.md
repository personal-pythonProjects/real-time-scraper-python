# Real-Time Scraper - Efficient Web Scraping with Python

This project demonstrates how to scrape book data **efficiently and in real-time** using Python. By leveraging `requests`, `BeautifulSoup`, and `yield`, we can extract book information from [Books to Scrape](https://books.toscrape.com/) while optimizing memory usage.

## Features
- Scrapes **title, price, and availability** of books.
- Uses **yield** to stream data efficiently without overloading memory.
- Saves extracted data to **book_list.txt**.
- Implements **error handling** for robustness.
